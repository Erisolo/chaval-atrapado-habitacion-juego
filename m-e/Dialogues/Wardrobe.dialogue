A normal wardrobe, with some photos of you and your friends on the door.
Your dear, dear friends.
Isn't friendship beauiful?
- See the pictures.
	You don't recognize the people in these photos.
	Who is that girl whose hair covers her face?
	Better cross her face off. Get her face off your wardrobe.
	No need to keep the face of a stranger in there.
	do Checklist.addChore("Photos", ["Check the photos", "Check the photos", "Check the photos", ""])
- Leave.

The smile of this person is... strange...
Have you ever seen them? I don't think so.
Ugh, such a creepy smile...
Cross. Them. Out. [shake] NOW. [/shake]
